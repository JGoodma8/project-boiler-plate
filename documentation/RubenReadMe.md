# Quick Explaination
- [ ] The Folder UI has all of mine (Jeanne's) pictures that the rest of the group used as a bases for the use cases.
- There are ALOT more here than I put on my powerpoint.
- Every subfolder of UI has a picture in it that is a picture of what the App's screen would look like.
- Every subfolder in UI represents a pertinent active button for that current stage in the app.
- For some reason, there is a binary file through out the UI folder called "thumbs".  Not sure what this is, but it's just a nuisance. 
- [ ] The rest of the group split up writing the use cases evenly.  
- [ ] The rest of the group have not (currently) got set-up for GitHub.  
- This will be remedied quickly. I really like GitHub's structure for groups.
- [ ] Merry Christmas!! See you next semester.
